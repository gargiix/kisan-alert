# 🌾 Kisan Alert

**AI-powered farming advisory platform for smallholder farmers — accessible via simple chat, no smartphone expertise required.**

## 📖 Overview

Small farmers make critical seasonal decisions — what to grow, when to irrigate, how to treat crop disease — largely based on habit and word-of-mouth, even though government soil, groundwater, satellite, and weather data already exists to inform better choices. That data rarely reaches farmers in a usable form.

**Kisan Alert** closes that gap by delivering personalized, AI-generated farming advice through a simple conversational interface, designed to eventually work over basic phone calls and SMS — no app, no smartphone, no internet literacy required.

## 🔗 Live Links

The project is fully deployed and live — the frontend and backend are hosted separately and communicate over a REST API.

**Live Application**
Explore the working chat interface and crop advisory dashboard here:

**Backend API**
The Flask server powering the AI responses, deployed independently on Render:

*Note: the backend runs on a free-tier server that sleeps after periods of inactivity — the first request after a while may take 20–30 seconds to respond.*

## ✨ Features

### ✅ Implemented

- **AI Farming Assistant Chat** — Conversational interface powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, tuned to give short, practical, SMS-style advice rather than generic long-form answers
- **Live Crop Advisory Dashboard** — Dynamically AI-generated crop suggestions (health metrics, growth stage, yield projections) instead of static sample data
- **Full-stack deployment** — Decoupled frontend/backend architecture, independently deployed and connected via REST API

### 🔜 Planned

- **IoT Soil Sensor Integration** — Real-time soil moisture, temperature, and humidity monitoring to trigger proactive irrigation alerts
- **Photo-Based Crop Diagnosis** — Farmers submit a photo of an affected crop; AI attempts diagnosis, with automatic escalation to the nearest **Rythu Bharosa Kendra** (government farmer help center) when confidence is low
- **SMS/Voice Call Access Layer** — Removing the need for a smartphone or app entirely

## 🚀 Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- A Google Gemini API key ([get one here](https://ai.google.dev/))

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Run the server:
```bash
python app.py
```

### Frontend Setup
